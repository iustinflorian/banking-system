# **PROJECT: Banking System Development**<br />
## **Objective**<br />
Create a robust banking system simulation with essential features such as deposit, withdraw, and transfer.<br />
## **Tasks**<br />
- [x] Implement the bank object with methods to handle deposit, withdraw, and transfer operations.<br />
- [x] Small-scale simulation to test overall functionality.<br />
- [ ] Enhance the code by making it fully input-sensitive. Avoid hardcoding data within the code itself, allowing for dynamic user interaction and adaptability.<br />
- [ ] Make final touches to the code. Incorporate exception handling for robustness.<br />
## **Skills**<br />
• Java programming<br />
• Error Handling (not yet)<br />
• Dynamic Input Handling (not yet)<br />
